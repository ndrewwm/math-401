# Meeting Summaries

## 2/14/24

- Reading and searching for more background information about multi-output Gaussian Processes
  - e.g., *vector-valued* GPs ([blog post](https://invenia.github.io/blog/2021/02/19/OILMM-pt1/))
  - Completed review of the multivariate Gaussian distribution ([link](./gaussian_processes/mvnorm/index.qmd))
  - Still working on modeling bivariate data, but not (yet) fruitfully

Ideally, we could model position and velocity together as a vector

$$
\begin{bmatrix} u \\ v \end{bmatrix} = f(x, y) + \epsilon
$$

rather than something like
$$
\begin{align*}
u &= f_1(x) + \epsilon_1 \\
v &= f_2(y) + \epsilon_2
\end{align*}
$$

## 1/31/25

- Working on [an overview of Gaussian processes](/gaussian_processes/index.qmd)
  - I have a more formal writeup (in the sense of notation) of GPR [here](/gaussian_processes/v2.qmd)
- Working on [an overview of KRR](/krr/index.qmd)
    - todos:
        - [ ] update citations

## 1/23/25

- Reviewed sections 1-3. Covered the algorithm that auths present on page N.
- Goal: try to have some workable code to demonstrate KRR and GPR on simulated data. Let's understand what the methods are producing.

## 1/16/25

- Discussion, admin work
- Decided to cover first 3 sections of __ paper
- Mentioned __ textbook.
