# Meeting Summaries

## 3/14/25

- Writeup of [multioutput GPR](/gaussian_processes/multioutput/index.qmd) is close to finished. Used data from a simulation of hurricane Isabel to test out the approach.
- I've been working on parameter estimation for multioutput GPR.
  - I've been using R.M.S.E. to measure performance on unseen test data.
  - My attempts to optimize the log-likelihood function were not giving better performance over naive defaults of $\alpha = 1$ and $\rho = 1$.
  - Due to this, I began testing out the Stan programming language for estimation, which appears to work a bit better (but not improving over the defaults).
- Multioutput GPR appears to relate to the idea of the *Matrix Normal* distribution. In some circumstances, it may be equivalent?

## 3/10/25

- I needed to cancel due to a conflict. We'll postpone until 3/14.

## 3/3/25

- Still working on code for multioutput GPR.
- Reviewed my CV and discussed topics related to Reflection 2.
  - Learned that Tukey was involved in a landmark implementation of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).

## 2/24/25

- Reading [Bonilla, Chai, & Williams (2007)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2007/file/66368270ffd51418ec58bd793f2d9b1b-Paper.pdf)
- Working towards implementing a simulation of [multi-task GPR](/gaussian_processes/multioutput/index.qmd)
- Last week, I completed a basic simulation of bivariate GPR, which can be viewed [here](/gaussian_processes/bivariate_case/index.qmd). It's light on theory/notation, but I think it follows fairly straightforwardly from the univariate case.
  - I need to actually start doing more formal parameter estimation for the kernel/covariance functions. Currently, I've just been using arbitrary values for $\alpha$, $\rho$ and $\sigma$ in the RBF kernel. These are fine for demonstration purposes, but aren't representative of what a fully application would entail.

## 2/14/25

- Reading and searching for more background information about multi-output Gaussian Processes
  - e.g., *vector-valued* GPs ([blog post](https://invenia.github.io/blog/2021/02/19/OILMM-pt1/))
  - Completed review of the multivariate Gaussian distribution ([link](./gaussian_processes/mvnorm/index.qmd))
  - Still working on modeling bivariate data, but not (yet) fruitfully

Ideally, we could model position and velocity together as a vector

$$
\begin{bmatrix} u \\ v \end{bmatrix} = f(x, y) + \epsilon
$$

rather than something like
$$
\begin{align*}
u &= f_1(x) + \epsilon_1 \\
v &= f_2(y) + \epsilon_2
\end{align*}
$$

## 1/31/25

- Working on [an overview of Gaussian processes](/gaussian_processes/index.qmd)
  - I have a more formal writeup (in the sense of notation) of GPR [here](/gaussian_processes/v2.qmd)
- Working on [an overview of KRR](/krr/index.qmd)
    - todos:
        - [ ] update citations

## 1/23/25

- Reviewed sections 1-3. Covered the algorithm that auths present on page N.
- Goal: try to have some workable code to demonstrate KRR and GPR on simulated data. Let's understand what the methods are producing.

## 1/16/25

- Discussion, admin work
- Decided to cover first 3 sections of __ paper
- Mentioned __ textbook.
