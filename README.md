# Math-401

This website contains the work I completed during the course of Math-401, my senior project and final course to complete my BS in Applied Mathematics. I completed this course during Spring 2025; [Dr. Grady Wright](https://gradywright.github.io/) (Professor, Boise State Department of Mathematics), served as my project advisor. During the course, I focused on the topic of *Gaussian Processes (GPs)*, a generalization of the multivariate Gaussian distribution, and how GPs can be useful in the context of various regression problems.

This website was built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), with data analysis, inference, and visualization being conducted using the R and Stan programming languages. My poster's layout was built from an excellent [typst](https://typst.app/) [template](https://github.com/quarto-ext/typst-templates/tree/main/poster), with a few formatting tweaks.
